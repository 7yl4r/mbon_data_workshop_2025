# Darwin Core - A global community of data sharing and integration
Darwin Core is a data standard that was originally created to mobilize and share natural history collection data but has expanded to allow of exchange and sharing of many types of biological data including citizen scientist data, ecological monitoring data, eDNA data, telemetry data, taxonomic treatments, and many other types of biological data. Darwin Core is applicable to any data that observes an organism (scientific name, OTU, or other methods of defining a species) at a particular place and time. In Darwin Core this is an `occurrence`. To learn more about the foundations of Darwin Core read [Wieczorek et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029715).

### Demonstrated Use of Darwin Core
The power of Darwin Core is most evident in the data aggregators that harvest data using that standard. The one we will refer to most frequently in this workshop is the [Ocean Biodiversity Information System](https://obis.org/) (learn more about [OBIS](https://youtu.be/E6NblAC-1uE)). Another prominent one is the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](https://www.gbif.org/) (learn more about [GBIF](https://vimeo.com/434831655)). It's also used by the Atlas of Living Australia, iDigBio among others. 

### Darwin Core Archives
Darwin Core Archives are what OBIS and GBIF are expecting to harvest into their systems. Fortunately the software created and maintained by GBIF, the [Integrated Publishing Toolkit](https://www.gbif.org/ipt) produces Darwin Core Archives for us. But Darwin Core Archives are pretty simple. It's a zipped folder containing the data (one or several files depending on how many extensions you use), an EML metadata XML file, and a meta.xml file that describes what's in the zipped folder.

> ## Exercise
> 
> Download this [Darwin Core Archive](https://www1.usgs.gov/obis-usa/ipt/archive.do?r=tpwd_harc_texasaransasbay_bagseine&v=2.3) and examine what's in it. Did you find anything unusual or that you don't understand what it is?

### Darwin Core Mapping
Now that we understand a bit more about why Darwin Core was created and how it's used today we can begin the work of mapping data to the standard. The key place you need when mapping data to Darwin Core is the [Darwin Core Quick Reference Guide](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/). But there are a lot of terms there and you won't use them all for every dataset (or even use them all on any dataset). You might use all the terms once you've mapped many datasets though ðŸ˜Š

> ## Exercise
> 
> Challenge: Find the matching Darwin Core term for these column headers.
> 
> 1. SAMPLE_DATE (example data: 09-MAR-21 05.45.00.000000000 PM)
> 2. lat (example data: 32.6560)
> 3. depth_m (example data: 6)
> 4. COMMON_NAME (example data: staghorn coral)
> 5. percent_cover (example data: 15)
> 6. COUNT (example data: 2 Females)
> 
> > ## Solution

> > 2. [`decimalLatitude`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:decimalLatitude)
> > 3. [`minimumDepthInMeters`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:minimumDepthInMeters) and [`maximumDepthInMeters`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:maximumDepthInMeters)
> > 4. [`vernacularName`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:vernacularName)
> > 5. [`organismQuantity`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:organismQuantity) and [`organismQuantityType`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:organismQuantityType)
> > 6. This one is tricky- it's two terms combined and will need to be split. [`indvidualCount`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:individualCount) and [`sex`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:sex)

### What are the Required Darwin Core terms for Publishing to OBIS?
When doing your mapping some required information may be missing. These are the Darwin Core terms that are required to share your data to OBIS plus a few that are needed for GBIF.

| Darwin Core Term | Definition             | Comment    |
|------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| [`occurrenceID`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:occurrenceID) | An identifier for the Occurrence (as opposed to a particular digital record of the occurrence). In the absence of a persistent global unique identifier, construct one from a combination of identifiers in the record that will most closely make the occurrenceID globally unique. | To construct a globally unique identifier for each occurrence you can usually concatenate station + date + scientific name (or something similar) but you'll need to check this is unique for each row in your data |
| [`basisOfRecord`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:basisOfRecord) | The specific nature of the data record.  | Controlled vocabulary: HumanObservation, MachineObservation, PreservedSpecimen, LivingSpecimen, FossilSpecimen|
| [`scientificName`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:scientificName) | The full scientific name, with authorship and date information if known. When forming part of an Identification, this should be the name in lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined. This term should not contain identification qualifications, which should instead be supplied in the IdentificationQualifier term. | Note that cf., aff., etc. need to be parsed out to the `identificationQualifier` term |
| [`scientificNameID`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:scientificNameID) | An identifier for the nomenclatural (not taxonomic) details of a scientific name. | Must be a WoRMS LSID for sharing to OBIS. Example: urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:218214. Note that the numbers at the end are the AphiaID from WoRMS. |
| [`eventDate`]() |  | |
| [`decimalLatitude`]() |  | |
| [`decimalLongitude`]() |  | |
| [`occurrenceStatus`]() |  | |
| [`countryCode`]() |  | |
| [`kingdom`]() |  |  |
| [`geodeticDatum`]() | | |
