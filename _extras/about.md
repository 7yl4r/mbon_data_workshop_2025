Marine Data Mobilization Workshop for Biology and Ecosystem Essential Ocean Variables (Bio-Eco EOV) is a Contribution to the UN Decade on Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and the [Marine Life 2030 Decade Action](https://www.oceandecade.org/resource/166/Announcement-of-the-results-of-the-first-endorsed-Decade-Actions-following-Call-for-Decade-Actions-No-012020). The workshop is jointly hosted by [CIOOS](https://www.cioos.ca/), [IOOS](https://ioos.noaa.gov/), Hakai, [MBON](http://marinebon.org/), [OBIS-USA](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis/obis-usa), and [OTN](https://oceantrackingnetwork.org/).


This workshop is a small hands-on, interactive virtual workshop focused on mobilizing marine biological observation datasets to the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) by helping data providers standardize their data using Darwin Core. This includes species observations from any type of sampling methodologies (e.g. visual surveys, net tows, microscopy, fish trawls, imaging, `omics, acoustics, telemetry).
