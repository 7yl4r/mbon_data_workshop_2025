This workshop is intended to be a small hands-on, interactive virtual workshop focused on mobilizing marine biological 
observation datasets to the [Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS)](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/setup.html) by helping data providers standardize their 
data using Darwin Core including species observations from any type of sampling methodologies (e.g. visual surveys, 
net tows, microscopy, fish trawls, imaging, 'omics, acoustics, telemetry).
