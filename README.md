**Ocean Sciences is all virtual and so are we!**
Since the Ocean Sciences conference will not be in person this year, our workshop will be entirely online.
Dates for the workshop will be 2022-03-14 and 2022-03-15.
Hopefully even more will be able to join this way!

## 2021-09-24 : Workshop Announcement
Join us for a Marine Data Mobilization Workshop for Biology and Ecosystem Essential Ocean Variables (Bio-Eco EOV) as a Contribution to the UN Decade on Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and the Marine Life 2030 Decade Action. 
The workshop is jointly hosted by CIOOS, IOOS, MBON, OBIS-USA, and OTN.

This workshop is intended to be a small hands-on, interactive in-person OR virtual workshop (to be decided by November 20) focused on mobilizing marine biological observation datasets to the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) by helping data providers standardize their data using Darwin Core including species observations from any type of sampling methodologies (e.g. visual surveys, net tows, microscopy, fish trawls, imaging, 'omics, acoustics, telemetry). 
The workshop will be held in association with the February Ocean Sciences Meeting (virtual: March 14 - 15, 2022).

Requirements to participate? 

* Must have a dataset to work on. 
* Must have some R or Python experience. 
* Must have a basic knowledge of Github. 
* Participants must bring a laptop with R and RStudio or Python software installed. 

Formal daily activities will take place over a period of up to 4 hours per day March 14 - 15, 2022 and will be optimized for timezones in the Americas.
